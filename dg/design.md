# Design

As described in the [_Tools_](tools.md) section, WATcher is an Angular application that is distributed as a web app.

This page describes WATcher's design. As an Angular application, the different
views of the WATcher app are built out of **components**, and the content displayed on these
views is constructed using data provided by **services**. In the following sections we will briefly describe the design of some views and services within WATcher.

## Views
